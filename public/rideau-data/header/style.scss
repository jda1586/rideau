//Notes: 
// - You can comment using double double slashes //, comment lines are ignored by the processor
// - Always end style definitions (with the structure key: value) with a semicolon (;) or the processor will fail to process the file
// - Use em's as much as possible for font-size rules, this will help the mobile experience. 16px is 1em always, see (http://pxtoem.com/)
